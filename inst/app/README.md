## Overview


The Minnesota (MN) Native Plant Community (NPC) Classification tool is an R 
Shiny application designed to assist users in assigning an NPC Class to their
vegetation plot data. It is based on the [vegetation classification system](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/npc/index.html)
built and maintained by the MN Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  

The **R** **M**odular **A**nalysis of **V**egetation **I**nformation
**S**ystem (`RMAVIS`) R Shiny web application is a tool to assist in the
assignment of vegetation plot sample data to GB National Vegetation
Classification units, with additional exploratory analyses.

We will update and improve `RMAVIS` over time in response to user
feedback and hope it acts as a useful tool for the GB ecology and
conservation community.

## Structure

There are 8 main sections in `RMAVIS` at present.

**Home** - Provides outlining information.

**Data Entry** - Facilitates data entry and makes available the
taxonomic information used by `RMAVIS`.

**NVC Analysis** - The core of the `RMAVIS` application, containing the
functionality present in the original v1.0 release.

**NVC Information** - Contains a set of searchable tables for inspecting
the NVC community names, taxon names, floristic tables, and community
attributes.

**Documentation** - Provides a more detailed overview of the underlying
methods, data sources, and usage instructions.

**News** - Contains the release log and additional news regarding the
development and maintenance of `RMAVIS`.

**Additional Information** - Contains other useful information.

**Privacy** - A privacy notice.
